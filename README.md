# ProjectilePath
ProjectilePath: A Physics-based Projectile Trajectory Simulation App

ProjectilePath is an interactive and educational application designed to simulate projectile motion and provide a visual representation of the parabolic trajectory of a projectile. The app allows users to input initial parameters such as launch angle, initial velocity, and gravitational force, instantly generating a dynamic simulation of the projectile's trajectory.

## Key Features:

* Real-time visualization of projectile motion: The app provides a clear and intuitive visual representation of the projectile's trajectory, showcasing the parabolic curve it follows.
* Customizable parameters: Users can easily adjust the launch angle and initial velocity to observe the effects on the projectile's trajectory.
* Comprehensive data display: The app shows real-time data on key metrics, such as maximum height reached, horizontal range, and time of flight.
* Interactive learning experience: ProjectilePath aims to enhance the understanding of projectile motion principles by providing an engaging and interactive learning environment.
* Educational resource: The app can be a valuable tool for physics students, educators, and anyone interested in exploring the fascinating world of projectile motion.

*The source code is written in Java and utilizes MPAndroidChart:v3.1.0. Whether you're a physics enthusiast or a student looking to grasp the fundamentals of projectile motion, feel free to explore, contribute, and learn from this open-source project.*
